In this notes we will cover the basic to advance level concepts of Git and Github.

Before we start the learning lets dicuss the problem why the git and github concept is important for every developer.

Understanding the problem?
    As we know the traditional software development was not effective as compare to current rapid software development. Why because in the traditional way we face many problems in software development. Let's say there are 4 members in software development team. Each member wants to develop own component. 
        For example: 
        Memeber A is creating Hero section, member B is creating About section, C focusing on designing the pages for better look using the css and last one is working on functionality of each components. After the finished their own work they want to merge in one progect. Question is that how they will merge these all codes into one project. On that time this was a big problem. That's why the experts bring the a enovative idea to change the entire development rules. Such a technology that iliminata the problems we call it today Git and Github.

Let's go to the understand the concept of Git:)
