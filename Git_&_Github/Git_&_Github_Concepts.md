In these notes, we will cover the basic to advanced level concepts of Git and GitHub.

Before we start learning, letâ€™s discuss why Git and GitHub are important for every developer.

Understanding the Problem
Traditional software development was not as effective as modern rapid development. This is because, in the traditional approach, many issues aroseâ€”especially when working in teams.

For example, imagine a software development team with four members:

    Member A is creating the Hero section,

    Member B is working on the About section,

    Member C is focusing on the design using CSS, and

    Member D is implementing functionality for each component.

Once everyone finishes their part, they need to combine their work into a single project. But how do they do that effectively? At that time, this was a major challenge.

To solve such problems, experts introduced an innovative idea that changed the way we develop softwareâ€”Git and GitHub. This technology helps eliminate the issues faced during collaboration and version control.

Now, letâ€™s dive into the concept of Git. ðŸ˜Š
