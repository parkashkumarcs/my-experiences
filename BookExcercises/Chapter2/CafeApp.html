    <h1>Example of Cafe Recipes - World's Best Scramble Eggs</h1>
    <p>I adapted this recipe from a book  called <a href="www.sydnev-food.com">Sydnev Food</a> by Bill Grainger.
    Ever since  testing these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurent  in Kings Cross, 
    Syndney, I have been after recipe. I have  since transformed  it into  what I really  bekieve are 
    the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.
    </p>
    <p>This recipe is what I call a <q> very Special breakfast</q>; just look at the ingredients to see why.
        It has to be tasted to be believed.
